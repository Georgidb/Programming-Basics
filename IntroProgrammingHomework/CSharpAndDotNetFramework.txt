Problem 13. C# and .NET Differences


.NET is an application development framework - it contains numerous libraries containing a range of functionality.
The framework defines the rules and supporting libraries that other languages shall use. It also helps you to call variable written in another language to be used in a different language.

C# is a strong Object Oriented programming language that is mostly built on the .NET framework.

Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework.
